    "long_description": "Smart iFrame lets you embed useful tools for your support representatives directly into the Zendesk Agent Workspace.\n\n# Getting Started\n\n1. Specify the URL of the website to embed, such as `https://mysite.com/ticket/{ticket_id}`\n2. Specify what height you want the embedded window to be (if not specified will default to `300px`)\n\nThe next time you open up a ticket, you'll have access to the Smart iFrame app, which will contain an embedded iFrame. You can use Zendesk's workspace builder to place this app whereever you like!\n\n> **NOTE: Not all websites allow themselves to be be loaded within an iFrame.** \n> If the site is not loading in Smart iFrame, contact the site administrator or 3rd party provider to discuss. See our [documentation](https://github.com/hubbubdev/zendesk-easy-iframe?tab=readme-ov-file#iframe-not-working) for more info.\n\n# Dynamic URLs with Template Strings\nIn the example URL above, `{ticket_id}` is a Smart iFrame template string which will pass the Zendesk Ticket ID into the URL when we load the iFrame.\nThis can be valuable in having the 3rd party applications load to unique profiles, dashboards, or other kinds of content specific to the requesting customer, the current user, or the ticket itself.\n\n## Template String Reference\n- `{ticket_id}` - Zendesk ticket ID\n- `{current_user_id}` - Current Zendesk user ID\n- `{current_user_email}` - Current Zendesk user email address\n- `{requester_id}` - Ticket requester Zendesk user ID\n- `{requester_email}` - Ticket requester email address\n- `{assignee_id}` - Ticket assignee (agent) Zendesk user ID\n- `{assignee_email}` - Ticketed assignee (agent) email address\n\n# Learn More\nMore info can be seen [here](https://github.com/hubbubdev/zendesk-easy-iframe) and if you have any questions, please reach out to support@hubbub.dev!",
